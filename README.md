# PSNotes

PSNotes is a PowerShell module that allows you to create your own custom snippet library, that you can use to reference commands you run often. Or ones you don't run often and need a reminder on. Snippets can either be executed directly, copied to your clipboard, or simply output to the display for you to do whatever you want with them. When you create a note you assign an alias to it, so you can have an easy to remember command that you can then use to recall it. Notes can also be classified with tags, so you can easily search for them.
